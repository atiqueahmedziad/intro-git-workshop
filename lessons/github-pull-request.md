Since we have cloned a repository into our local machine, lets make some local changes in it.
Before starting to make changes -

- Open a new branch.

Once we are doing with making changes, do the following -

- add the changes to index/staging area.
- commit the the changes.
- push the changes in your remote forked repository.

Since we have made some experimental changes, let's open a pull request suggesting our changes.

## Open A Pull Request

- Go to our experimental branch in Github.
- Click on "new pull request" button.
- Click on "Create pull request" button.

It will show us the changes we have made differenciate with the branch where we are sending the pull request.
