The following contains some questions often people asked me -

1. Why use Git command line when Git GUI with/without IDE is available?

   There is nothing wrong with using Git GUI as long as it serves your purpose. But whether you use GUI or command line, you must have concrete understanding of Git's workflow. Take this into account that, GUIs varies from IDE to IDE and may not support all Git commands.

   Git is meant to be a command line tool. [Command line is the only place you can run all Git commands][git-cmd]. The other benefits of using command line over GUI:

   1. GUI may update, may change its look. Also GUI differs from IDE to IDE. Then you have to figure out how to do what in new GUI. But Git commands will mostly be same forever.

   2. While working on server such as - Linux VPS, you won't get GUI to interact with. Then the only way to interact with system is a bunch of commands.

For these reasons, we will be moving forward with command line for this workshop.
