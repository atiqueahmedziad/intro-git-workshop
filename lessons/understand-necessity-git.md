## Why "understanding the necessity" is necessary ?

Understanding the necessity of learning anything pushes us to learn that thing more perfectly. I do believe before learning anything new we should ask ourselves a lot of "why/what" questions like why should we learn it? Is learning that thing solves any of your existing problems? What are the real-world applications of learning that thing? etc..
Answering the above questions, we should be to understand the importance of learning a new thing.
In this workshop, we will be learning about Git and Github. Before starting learning about them, let's understand why do we actually need it? This is also one of our objectives for this workshop too. For better understanding, I will be demonstrating one of my projects that got the benefit of using Git and Github. I will also be showing how I have collaboratively worked with my project mates using Github.

## Problems we often face

Let's start discussing our problems while working on software development projects at University -

- Files are not organized. One's files are not working on other's computer or several bugs are being found while trying to run another person's project files.
- We are not being able to work parallelly with our teammates.
- The software is broken at the deadline / final submission.
- Hard to find the code changes that broke our software.

## How Git & Github helped me to solve above problems in my project

For this I am going to demostrate one of my project, i.e. [Easy Project Management Tool][epmt], on which I have worked for two semesters (Java and Database).
