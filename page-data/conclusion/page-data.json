I want to thank you for joining me in this workshop.</p>\n<p>My objective was to give you the basic understanding of some important part of git (commit, push, rebase, pull, merge conflict etc) and Github (clone, fork, pull request etc.). Now, it's your responsibility to learn more about them and how they work under the hood. I believe topics that we have covered in this workshop are what we require to get ourselves into software development using git and github. I don't expect you to understand everything that we have done together but I expect you to learn more by googling what you didn't understand. You can also reach me if you don't find any solution of your problems after googling.</p>\n<h2 id=\"reference\"><a href=\"#reference\" aria-label=\"reference permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reference</h2>\n<p>I always prefer official documentation for better learning experience.
