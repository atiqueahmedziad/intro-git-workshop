I do believe before learning anything new we should ask ourselves a lot of \"why/what\" questions like why should we learn it? Is learning that thing solves any of your existing problems? What are the real-world applications of learning that thing? etc..\nAnswering the above questions, we should be to understand the importance of learning a new thing.\nIn this workshop, we will be learning about Git and Github. Before starting learning about them, let's understand why do we actually need it? This is also one of our objectives for this workshop too. For better understanding, I will be demonstrating one of my projects that got the benefit of using Git and Github. I will also be showing how I have collaboratively worked with my project mates using Github.</p>\n<h2 id=\"problems-we-often-face\"><a href=\"#problems-we-often-face\" aria-label=\"problems we often face permalink\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Problems we often face</h2>\n<p>Let's start discussing our problems while working on software development projects at University -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Files are not organized.
